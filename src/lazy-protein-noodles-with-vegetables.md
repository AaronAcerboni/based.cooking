# Lazy Protein Noodles with Vegetables

A quick high protein meal consisting of pre-packaged noodles, pre-cooked chicken, a boiled egg and chopped veggies. Calories can be lowered if you choose a lighter noodle brand and or abstain from using the oil sachet which is sometimes included. The recipe can match a large appetite or multiple eaters by simply increasing the noodles, egg and chicken quantity.
